Project for course BigData &amp; CloudComputing in the Master of Computer Science for the year 2023-2024.


# Note:

To run koalas, hadoop is necessary on the machine. To install it in windows, we used the tutorial in [this](https://gist.github.com/vorpal56/5e2b67b6be3a827b85ac82a63a5b3b2e) repository.

Get hadoop [here](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.6/hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz) and use this for the tutorial
